Python Package Starter
======================

Do you ever get tired of creating the same basic python project skeleton every
time you have a cool new idea? Or maybe this is your first project and you want
to do it the right way but are feeling overwhelmed by all the little details no
one ever told you about?

Well do I have news for you! Regardless of whether or
not this is your 1st, 9th, or 100th python package, the Python Package Starter
is here to make your life easier! Simply download and use the package as
described below and start developing now!

Python project layout is modeled on this excellent guide:

A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
