# PyPiStart

Do you ever get tired of creating the same basic python project skeleton every
time you have a cool new idea? Or maybe this is your first project and you want
to do it the right way but are feeling overwhelmed by all the little details no
one ever told you about?

Well do I have news for you! Regardless of whether or
not this is your 1st, 9th, or 100th python package, PyPiStart, the python package starter,
is here to make your life easier! Simply download and use the package as

## Python Environment Setup

First, make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

Then, run through the following commands:

* `python -m venv .venv_w266_project`
* Windows: `.venv_w266_project\Scripts\activate.bat`
* Linux: `source .venv_w266_project/bin/activate`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` - this will install all required packages and might take several minutes
